# CV Application

This project was created with `create-react-app` as the React introduction project in [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

## How to run?

Run the command `npm install`.

If you want to run the page locally, simply run `npm run start` in the terminal.

If you want to deploy it, first run `npm run build` and then deploy the `build` folder your way.

## How to use the application?

Hover on any of the section, that section's edit button will appear, allowing you to insert your information.

There's a download button in the bottom left corner of the screen, which will download the modified CV in pdf format.

## What I learnt

This project gave me a first look at React - class based specifically, and introduced the component-based design mindset. It has been a long time since I last touch HTML and CSS, so it was a solid revision.

Aside from that, I also learnt how to allow users to download HTML elements as PDF and how to use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)'s amazing free icons.

Overall, a nice and simple introduction to React.
