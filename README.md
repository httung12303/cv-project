# Idea

How I'll structure the web page:
- The preview version of the CV will be displayed by default.
- The CV will be split into multiple sections:
  - General information
    - Name, title, birthday, phone, email, address, link
  - Education
    - Major, time, institution, description
  - Work exp
    - Title, time, company, description
  - Prizes
    - Name, time
  - Skills
    - Name and brief description
  - Certifications
    - Name, time
- Users hover each of these sections to show their edit button, which will display their forms accordingly
- Options to download and see example.
